# Career Day - Movie Recommendation Algorithm Example

This is an example of an algorithm that will recommend movies to a user. It looks at movies that the user has watched (and liked) in the past, finds other users that have liked those same movies, and then finds movies that those other users have seen that our user has **not** seen.

This algorithm is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Below are some of my favorite resources that helped me learn Python. My favorite resources are listed in **bold**. I've listed both free and paid tutorials. Start with some of the free tutorials and if you want to learn more, check out the paid ones.
